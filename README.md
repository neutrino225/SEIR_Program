# SEIR_Program

One of the most commonly used mathematical algorithms to describe the diffusion of an epidemic disease is the SEIR model where:<br />

**S** is the fraction of susceptible individuals (those able to contract the disease).<br />
**E** is the fraction of exposed individuals (those who have been infected but are not yet infectious).<br />
**I** is the fraction of infective individuals (those capable of transmitting the disease).<br />
**R** is the fraction of recovered individuals (those who have become immune).<br />
